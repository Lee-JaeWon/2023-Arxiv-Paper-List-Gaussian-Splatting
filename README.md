| 79 | SC-GS: Sparse-Controlled Gaussian Splatting for Editable Dynamic Scenes | Yi-Hua Huang,Yang-Tian Sun,Ziyi Yang,Xiaoyang Lyu,Yan-Pei Cao,Xiaojuan Qi | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Novel view synthesis for dynamic scenes is still a challenging problem in computer vision and graphics. Recently, Gaussian splatting has emerged as a robust technique to represent static scenes and enable high-quality and real-time novel view synthesis. Building upon this technique, we propose a new representation that explicitly decomposes the motion and appearance of dynamic scenes into sparse control points and dense Gaussians, respectively. Our key idea is to use sparse control points, significantly fewer in number than the Gaussians, to learn compact 6 DoF transformation bases, which can be locally interpolated through learned interpolation weights to yield the motion field of 3D Gaussians. We employ a deformation MLP to predict time-varying 6 DoF transformations for each control point, which reduces learning complexities, enhances learning abilities, and facilitates obtaining temporal and spatial coherent motion patterns. Then, we jointly learn the 3D Gaussians, the canonical space locations of control points, and the deformation MLP to reconstruct the appearance, geometry, and dynamics of 3D scenes. During learning, the location and number of control points are adaptively adjusted to accommodate varying motion complexities in different regions, and an ARAP loss following the principle of as rigid as possible is developed to enforce spatial continuity and local rigidity of learned motions. Finally, thanks to the explicit sparse motion representation and its decomposition from appearance, our method can enable user-controlled motion editing while retaining high-fidelity appearances. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing approaches on novel view synthesis with a high rendering speed and enables novel appearance-preserved motion editing applications.

| 78 | DreamGaussian4D: Generative 4D Gaussian Splatting | Jiawei Ren,Liang Pan,Jiaxiang Tang,Chi Zhang,Ang Cao,Gang Zeng,Ziwei Liu | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Remarkable progress has been made in 4D content generation recently. However, existing methods suffer from long optimization time, lack of motion controllability, and a low level of detail. In this paper, we introduce DreamGaussian4D, an efficient 4D generation framework that builds on 4D Gaussian Splatting representation. Our key insight is that the explicit modeling of spatial transformations in Gaussian Splatting makes it more suitable for the 4D generation setting compared with implicit representations. DreamGaussian4D reduces the optimization time from several hours to just a few minutes, allows flexible control of the generated 3D motion, and produces animated meshes that can be efficiently rendered in 3D engines.</details> | December 2023. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17142](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17142) |
| 77 | Spacetime Gaussian Feature Splatting for Real-Time Dynamic View Synthesis | Zhan Li,Zhang Chen,Zhong Li,Yi Xu | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Novel view synthesis of dynamic scenes has been an intriguing yet challenging problem. Despite recent advancements, simultaneously achieving high-resolution photorealistic results, real-time rendering, and compact storage remains a formidable task. To address these challenges, we propose Spacetime Gaussian Feature Splatting as a novel dynamic scene representation, composed of three pivotal components. First, we formulate expressive Spacetime Gaussians by enhancing 3D Gaussians with temporal opacity and parametric motion/rotation. This enables Spacetime Gaussians to capture static, dynamic, as well as transient content within a scene. Second, we introduce splatted feature rendering, which replaces spherical harmonics with neural features. These features facilitate the modeling of view- and time-dependent appearance while maintaining small size. Third, we leverage the guidance of training error and coarse depth to sample new Gaussians in areas that are challenging to converge with existing pipelines. Experiments on several established real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality and speed, while retaining compact storage. At 8K resolution, our lite-version model can render at 60 FPS on an Nvidia RTX 4090 GPU.</details> | December 2023. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16812](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16812) |
| 76 | LangSplat: 3D Language Gaussian Splatting | Minghan Qin,Wanhua Li,Jiawei Zhou,Haoqian Wang,Hanspeter Pfister | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Human lives in a 3D world and commonly uses natural language to interact with a 3D scene. Modeling a 3D language field to support open-ended language queries in 3D has gained increasing attention recently. This paper introduces LangSplat, which constructs a 3D language field that enables precise and efficient open-vocabulary querying within 3D spaces. Unlike existing methods that ground CLIP language embeddings in a NeRF model, LangSplat advances the field by utilizing a collection of 3D Gaussians, each encoding language features distilled from CLIP, to represent the language field. By employing a tile-based splatting technique for rendering language features, we circumvent the costly rendering process inherent in NeRF. Instead of directly learning CLIP embeddings, LangSplat first trains a scene-wise language autoencoder and then learns language features on the scene-specific latent space, thereby alleviating substantial memory demands imposed by explicit modeling. Existing methods struggle with imprecise and vague 3D language fields, which fail to discern clear boundaries between objects. We delve into this issue and propose to learn hierarchical semantics using SAM, thereby eliminating the need for extensively querying the language field across various scales and the regularization of DINO features. Extensive experiments on open-vocabulary 3D object localization and semantic segmentation demonstrate that LangSplat significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method LERF by a large margin. Notably, LangSplat is extremely efficient, achieving a {\\speed} $\\times$ speedup compared to LERF at the resolution of 1440 $\\times$ 1080. We strongly recommend readers to check out our video results at https://langsplat.github.io</details> | December 2023. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16084](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16084) |
| 75 | Human101: Training 100+FPS Human Gaussians in 100s from 1 View | Mingwei Li,Jiachen Tao,Zongxin Yang,Yi Yang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Reconstructing the human body from single-view videos plays a pivotal role in the virtual reality domain. One prevalent application scenario necessitates the rapid reconstruction of high-fidelity 3D digital humans while simultaneously ensuring real-time rendering and interaction. Existing methods often struggle to fulfill both requirements. In this paper, we introduce Human101, a novel framework adept at producing high-fidelity dynamic 3D human reconstructions from 1-view videos by training 3D Gaussians in 100 seconds and rendering in 100+ FPS. Our method leverages the strengths of 3D Gaussian Splatting, which provides an explicit and efficient representation of 3D humans. Standing apart from prior NeRF-based pipelines, Human101 ingeniously applies a Human-centric Forward Gaussian Animation method to deform the parameters of 3D Gaussians, thereby enhancing rendering speed (i.e., rendering 1024-resolution images at an impressive 60+ FPS and rendering 512-resolution images at 100+ FPS). Experimental results indicate that our approach substantially eclipses current methods, clocking up to a 10 times surge in frames per second and delivering comparable or superior rendering quality. Code and demos will be released at https://github.com/longxiang-ai/Human101.</details> | December 2023. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15258](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15258) |
| 74 | Deformable 3D Gaussian Splatting for Animatable Human Avatars | HyunJun Jung,Nikolas Brasch,Jifei Song,Eduardo Perez-Pellitero,Yiren Zhou,Zhihao Li,Nassir Navab,Benjamin Busam | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Recent advances in neural radiance fields enable novel view synthesis of photo-realistic images in dynamic settings, which can be applied to scenarios with human animation. Commonly used implicit backbones to establish accurate models, however, require many input views and additional annotations such as human masks, UV maps and depth maps. In this work, we propose ParDy-Human (Parameterized Dynamic Human Avatar), a fully explicit approach to construct a digital avatar from as little as a single monocular sequence. ParDy-Human introduces parameter-driven dynamics into 3D Gaussian Splatting where 3D Gaussians are deformed by a human pose model to animate the avatar. Our method is composed of two parts: A first module that deforms canonical 3D Gaussians according to SMPL vertices and a consecutive module that further takes their designed joint encodings and predicts per Gaussian deformations to deal with dynamics beyond SMPL vertex deformations. Images are then synthesized by a rasterizer. ParDy-Human constitutes an explicit model for realistic dynamic human avatars which requires significantly fewer training views and images. Our avatars learning is free of additional annotations such as masks and can be trained with variable backgrounds while inferring full-resolution images efficiently even on consumer hardware. We provide experimental evidence to show that ParDy-Human outperforms state-of-the-art methods on ZJU-MoCap and THUman4.0 datasets both quantitatively and visually.</details> | December 2023. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15059](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15059) |
| 73 | Gaussian Splatting with NeRF-based Color and Opacity | Dawid Malarz,Weronika Smolak,Jacek Tabor,S\xc5\x82awomir Tadeja,Przemys\xc5\x82aw Spurek | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have demonstrated the remarkable potential of neural networks to capture the intricacies of 3D objects. By encoding the shape and color information within neural network weights, NeRFs excel at producing strikingly sharp novel views of 3D objects. Recently, numerous generalizations of NeRFs utilizing generative models have emerged, expanding its versatility. In contrast, Gaussian Splatting (GS) offers a similar renders quality with faster training and inference as it does not need neural networks to work. We encode information about the 3D objects in the set of Gaussian distributions that can be rendered in 3D similarly to classical meshes. Unfortunately, GS are difficult to condition since they usually require circa hundred thousand Gaussian components. To mitigate the caveats of both models, we propose a hybrid model that uses GS representation of the 3D object's shape and NeRF-based encoding of color and opacity. Our model uses Gaussian distributions with trainable positions (i.e. means of Gaussian), shape (i.e. covariance of Gaussian), color and opacity, and neural network, which takes parameters of Gaussian and viewing direction to produce changes in color and opacity. Consequently, our model better describes shadows, light reflections, and transparency of 3D objects.</details> | December 2023. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13729](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13729) |
| 72 | pixelSplat: 3D Gaussian Splats from Image Pairs for Scalable Generalizable 3D Reconstruction | David Charatan,Sizhe Li,Andrea Tagliasacchi,Vincent Sitzmann | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We introduce pixelSplat, a feed-forward model that learns to reconstruct 3D radiance fields parameterized by 3D Gaussian primitives from pairs of images. Our model features real-time and memory-efficient rendering for scalable training as well as fast 3D reconstruction at inference time. To overcome local minima inherent to sparse and locally supported representations, we predict a dense probability distribution over 3D and sample Gaussian means from that probability distribution. We make this sampling operation differentiable via a reparameterization trick, allowing us to back-propagate gradients through the Gaussian splatting representation. We benchmark our method on wide-baseline novel view synthesis on the real-world RealEstate10k and ACID datasets, where we outperform state-of-the-art light field transformers and accelerate rendering by 2.5 orders of magnitude while reconstructing an interpretable and editable 3D radiance field.</details> | December 2023. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12337](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12337) |
| 71 | Splatter Image: Ultra-Fast Single-View 3D Reconstruction | Stanislaw Szymanowicz,Christian Rupprecht,Andrea Vedaldi | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We introduce the Splatter Image, an ultra-fast approach for monocular 3D object reconstruction which operates at 38 FPS. Splatter Image is based on Gaussian Splatting, which has recently brought real-time rendering, fast training, and excellent scaling to multi-view reconstruction. For the first time, we apply Gaussian Splatting in a monocular reconstruction setting. Our approach is learning-based, and, at test time, reconstruction only requires the feed-forward evaluation of a neural network. The main innovation of Splatter Image is the surprisingly straightforward design: it uses a 2D image-to-image network to map the input image to one 3D Gaussian per pixel. The resulting Gaussians thus have the form of an image, the Splatter Image. We further extend the method to incorporate more than one image as input, which we do by adding cross-view attention. Owning to the speed of the renderer (588 FPS), we can use a single GPU for training while generating entire images at each iteration in order to optimize perceptual metrics like LPIPS. On standard benchmarks, we demonstrate not only fast reconstruction but also better results than recent and much more expensive baselines in terms of PSNR, LPIPS, and other metrics.</details> | December 2023. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13150](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13150) |
| 70 | GaussianEditor: Swift and Controllable 3D Editing with Gaussian Splatting | Yiwen Chen,Zilong Chen,Chi Zhang,Feng Wang,Xiaofeng Yang,Yikai Wang,Zhongang Cai,Lei Yang,Huaping Liu,Guosheng Lin | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D editing plays a crucial role in many areas such as gaming and virtual reality. Traditional 3D editing methods, which rely on representations like meshes and point clouds, often fall short in realistically depicting complex scenes. On the other hand, methods based on implicit 3D representations, like Neural Radiance Field (NeRF), render complex scenes effectively but suffer from slow processing speeds and limited control over specific scene areas. In response to these challenges, our paper presents GaussianEditor, an innovative and efficient 3D editing algorithm based on Gaussian Splatting (GS), a novel 3D representation. GaussianEditor enhances precision and control in editing through our proposed Gaussian semantic tracing, which traces the editing target throughout the training process. Additionally, we propose Hierarchical Gaussian splatting (HGS) to achieve stabilized and fine results under stochastic generative guidance from 2D diffusion models. We also develop editing strategies for efficient object removal and integration, a challenging task for existing methods. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate GaussianEditor's superior control, efficacy, and rapid performance, marking a significant advancement in 3D editing.

| 69 | SWAGS: Sampling Windows Adaptively for Dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting | Richard Shaw,Jifei Song,Arthur Moreau,Michal Nazarczuk,Sibi Catley-Chandar,Helisa Dhamo,Eduardo Perez-Pellitero | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Novel view synthesis has shown rapid progress recently, with methods capable of producing evermore photo-realistic results. 3D Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a particularly promising method, producing high-quality renderings of static scenes and enabling interactive viewing at real-time frame rates. However, it is currently limited to static scenes only. In this work, we extend 3D Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct dynamic scenes. We model the dynamics of a scene using a tunable MLP, which learns the deformation field from a canonical space to a set of 3D Gaussians per frame. To disentangle the static and dynamic parts of the scene, we learn a tuneable parameter for each Gaussian, which weighs the respective MLP parameters to focus attention on the dynamic parts. This improves the model's ability to capture dynamics in scenes with an imbalance of static to dynamic regions. To handle scenes of arbitrary length whilst maintaining high rendering quality, we introduce an adaptive window sampling strategy to partition the sequence into windows based on the amount of movement in the sequence. We train a separate dynamic Gaussian Splatting model for each window, allowing the canonical representation to change, thus enabling the reconstruction of scenes with significant geometric or topological changes. Temporal consistency is enforced using a fine-tuning step with self-supervising consistency loss on randomly sampled novel views. As a result, our method produces high-quality renderings of general dynamic scenes with competitive quantitative performance, which can be viewed in real-time with our dynamic interactive viewer.</details> | December 2023. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13308](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13308) |
| 68 | Compact 3D Scene Representation via Self-Organizing Gaussian Grids | Wieland Morgenstern,Florian Barthel,Anna Hilsmann,Peter Eisert | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian Splatting has recently emerged as a highly promising technique for modeling of static 3D scenes. In contrast to Neural Radiance Fields, it utilizes efficient rasterization allowing for very fast rendering at high-quality. However, the storage size is significantly higher, which hinders practical deployment, e.g.~on resource constrained devices. In this paper, we introduce a compact scene representation organizing the parameters of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) into a 2D grid with local homogeneity, ensuring a drastic reduction in storage requirements without compromising visual quality during rendering. Central to our idea is the explicit exploitation of perceptual redundancies present in natural scenes. In essence, the inherent nature of a scene allows for numerous permutations of Gaussian parameters to equivalently represent it. To this end, we propose a novel highly parallel algorithm that regularly arranges the high-dimensional Gaussian parameters into a 2D grid while preserving their neighborhood structure. During training, we further enforce local smoothness between the sorted parameters in the grid. The uncompressed Gaussians use the same structure as 3DGS, ensuring a seamless integration with established renderers. Our method achieves a reduction factor of 8x to 26x in size for complex scenes with no increase in training time, marking a substantial leap forward in the domain of 3D scene distribution and consumption.

| 67 | GAvatar: Animatable 3D Gaussian Avatars with Implicit Mesh Learning | Ye Yuan,Xueting Li,Yangyi Huang,Shalini De Mello,Koki Nagano,Jan Kautz,Umar Iqbal | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Gaussian splatting has emerged as a powerful 3D representation that harnesses the advantages of both explicit (mesh) and implicit (NeRF) 3D representations. In this paper, we seek to leverage Gaussian splatting to generate realistic animatable avatars from textual descriptions, addressing the limitations (e.g., flexibility and efficiency) imposed by mesh or NeRF-based representations. However, a naive application of Gaussian splatting cannot generate high-quality animatable avatars and suffers from learning instability; it also cannot capture fine avatar geometries and often leads to degenerate body parts. To tackle these problems, we first propose a primitive-based 3D Gaussian representation where Gaussians are defined inside pose-driven primitives to facilitate animation. Second, to stabilize and amortize the learning of millions of Gaussians, we propose to use neural implicit fields to predict the Gaussian attributes (e.g., colors). Finally, to capture fine avatar geometries and extract detailed meshes, we propose a novel SDF-based implicit mesh learning approach for 3D Gaussians that regularizes the underlying geometries and extracts highly detailed textured meshes. Our proposed method, GAvatar, enables the large-scale generation of diverse animatable avatars using only text prompts. GAvatar significantly surpasses existing methods in terms of both appearance and geometry quality, and achieves extremely fast rendering (100 fps) at 1K resolution.</details> | December 2023. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11461](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11461) |
| 66 | GauFRe: Gaussian Deformation Fields for Real-time Dynamic Novel View Synthesis | Yiqing Liang,Numair Khan,Zhengqin Li,Thu Nguyen-Phuoc,Douglas Lanman,James Tompkin,Lei Xiao | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We propose a method for dynamic scene reconstruction using deformable 3D Gaussians that is tailored for monocular video. Building upon the efficiency of Gaussian splatting, our approach extends the representation to accommodate dynamic elements via a deformable set of Gaussians residing in a canonical space, and a time-dependent deformation field defined by a multi-layer perceptron (MLP). Moreover, under the assumption that most natural scenes have large regions that remain static, we allow the MLP to focus its representational power by additionally including a static Gaussian point cloud. The concatenated dynamic and static point clouds form the input for the Gaussian Splatting rasterizer, enabling real-time rendering. The differentiable pipeline is optimized end-to-end with a self-supervised rendering loss. Our method achieves results that are comparable to state-of-the-art dynamic neural radiance field methods while allowing much faster optimization and rendering.

| 65 | Triplane Meets Gaussian Splatting: Fast and Generalizable Single-View 3D Reconstruction with Transformers | Zi-Xin Zou,Zhipeng Yu,Yuan-Chen Guo,Yangguang Li,Ding Liang,Yan-Pei Cao,Song-Hai Zhang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Recent advancements in 3D reconstruction from single images have been driven by the evolution of generative models. Prominent among these are methods based on Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) and the adaptation of diffusion models in the 3D domain. Despite their progress, these techniques often face limitations due to slow optimization or rendering processes, leading to extensive training and optimization times. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for single-view reconstruction that efficiently generates a 3D model from a single image via feed-forward inference. Our method utilizes two transformer-based networks, namely a point decoder and a triplane decoder, to reconstruct 3D objects using a hybrid Triplane-Gaussian intermediate representation. This hybrid representation strikes a balance, achieving a faster rendering speed compared to implicit representations while simultaneously delivering superior rendering quality than explicit representations. The point decoder is designed for generating point clouds from single images, offering an explicit representation which is then utilized by the triplane decoder to query Gaussian features for each point. This design choice addresses the challenges associated with directly regressing explicit 3D Gaussian attributes characterized by their non-structural nature. Subsequently, the 3D Gaussians are decoded by an MLP to enable rapid rendering through splatting. Both decoders are built upon a scalable, transformer-based architecture and have been efficiently trained on large-scale 3D datasets. The evaluations conducted on both synthetic datasets and real-world images demonstrate that our method not only achieves higher quality but also ensures a faster runtime in comparison to previous state-of-the-art techniques.

| 64 | 3DGS-Avatar: Animatable Avatars via Deformable 3D Gaussian Splatting | Zhiyin Qian,Shaofei Wang,Marko Mihajlovic,Andreas Geiger,Siyu Tang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We introduce an approach that creates animatable human avatars from monocular videos using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Existing methods based on neural radiance fields (NeRFs) achieve high-quality novel-view/novel-pose image synthesis but often require days of training, and are extremely slow at inference time. Recently, the community has explored fast grid structures for efficient training of clothed avatars. Albeit being extremely fast at training, these methods can barely achieve an interactive rendering frame rate with around 15 FPS. In this paper, we use 3D Gaussian Splatting and learn a non-rigid deformation network to reconstruct animatable clothed human avatars that can be trained within 30 minutes and rendered at real-time frame rates (50+ FPS). Given the explicit nature of our representation, we further introduce as-isometric-as-possible regularizations on both the Gaussian mean vectors and the covariance matrices, enhancing the generalization of our model on highly articulated unseen poses. Experimental results show that our method achieves comparable and even better performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches on animatable avatar creation from a monocular input, while being 400x and 250x faster in training and inference, respectively.</details> | December 2023. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09228](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09228) |
| 63 | Exploring the Feasibility of Generating Realistic 3D Models of Endangered Species Using DreamGaussian: An Analysis of Elevation Angle's Impact on Model Generation | Selcuk Anil Karatopak,Deniz Sen | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Many species face the threat of extinction. It's important to study these species and gather information about them as much as possible to preserve biodiversity. Due to the rarity of endangered species, there is a limited amount of data available, making it difficult to apply data requiring generative AI methods to this domain. We aim to study the feasibility of generating consistent and real-like 3D models of endangered animals using limited data. Such a phenomenon leads us to utilize zero-shot stable diffusion models that can generate a 3D model out of a single image of the target species. This paper investigates the intricate relationship between elevation angle and the output quality of 3D model generation, focusing on the innovative approach presented in DreamGaussian. DreamGaussian, a novel framework utilizing Generative Gaussian Splatting along with novel mesh extraction and refinement algorithms, serves as the focal point of our study. We conduct a comprehensive analysis, analyzing the effect of varying elevation angles on DreamGaussian's ability to reconstruct 3D scenes accurately. Through an empirical evaluation, we demonstrate how changes in elevation angle impact the generated images' spatial coherence, structural integrity, and perceptual realism. We observed that giving a correct elevation angle with the input image significantly affects the result of the generated 3D model. We hope this study to be influential for the usability of AI to preserve endangered animals; while the penultimate aim is to obtain a model that can output biologically consistent 3D models via small samples, the qualitative interpretation of an existing state-of-the-art model such as DreamGaussian will be a step forward in our goal.</details> | December 2023. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09682](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09682) |
| 62 | iComMa: Inverting 3D Gaussians Splatting for Camera Pose Estimation via Comparing and Matching | Yuan Sun,Xuan Wang,Yunfan Zhang,Jie Zhang,Caigui Jiang,Yu Guo,Fei Wang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We present a method named iComMa to address the 6D pose estimation problem in computer vision. The conventional pose estimation methods typically rely on the target's CAD model or necessitate specific network training tailored to particular object classes. Some existing methods address mesh-free 6D pose estimation by employing the inversion of a Neural Radiance Field (NeRF), aiming to overcome the aforementioned constraints. However, it still suffers from adverse initializations. By contrast, we model the pose estimation as the problem of inverting the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) with both the comparing and matching loss. In detail, a render-and-compare strategy is adopted for the precise estimation of poses. Additionally, a matching module is designed to enhance the model's robustness against adverse initializations by minimizing the distances between 2D keypoints. This framework systematically incorporates the distinctive characteristics and inherent rationale of render-and-compare and matching-based approaches. This comprehensive consideration equips the framework to effectively address a broader range of intricate and challenging scenarios, including instances with substantial angular deviations, all while maintaining a high level of prediction accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate the superior precision and robustness of our proposed jointly optimized framework when evaluated on synthetic and complex real-world data in challenging scenarios.</details> | December 2023. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09031](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09031) |
| 61 | DrivingGaussian: Composite Gaussian Splatting for Surrounding Dynamic Autonomous Driving Scenes | Xiaoyu Zhou,Zhiwei Lin,Xiaojun Shan,Yongtao Wang,Deqing Sun,Ming-Hsuan Yang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We present DrivingGaussian, an efficient and effective framework for surrounding dynamic autonomous driving scenes. For complex scenes with moving objects, we first sequentially and progressively model the static background of the entire scene with incremental static 3D Gaussians. We then leverage a composite dynamic Gaussian graph to handle multiple moving objects, individually reconstructing each object and restoring their accurate positions and occlusion relationships within the scene. We further use a LiDAR prior for Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct scenes with greater details and maintain panoramic consistency. DrivingGaussian outperforms existing methods in driving scene reconstruction and enables photorealistic surround-view synthesis with high-fidelity and multi-camera consistency. The source code and trained models will be released.</details> | December 2023. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07920](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07920) |
| 60 | COLMAP-Free 3D Gaussian Splatting | Yang Fu,Sifei Liu,Amey Kulkarni,Jan Kautz,Alexei A. Efros,Xiaolong Wang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>While neural rendering has led to impressive advances in scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis, it relies heavily on accurately pre-computed camera poses. To relax this constraint, multiple efforts have been made to train Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) without pre-processed camera poses. However, the implicit representations of NeRFs provide extra challenges to optimize the 3D structure and camera poses at the same time. On the other hand, the recently proposed 3D Gaussian Splatting provides new opportunities given its explicit point cloud representations. This paper leverages both the explicit geometric representation and the continuity of the input video stream to perform novel view synthesis without any SfM preprocessing. We process the input frames in a sequential manner and progressively grow the 3D Gaussians set by taking one input frame at a time, without the need to pre-compute the camera poses. Our method significantly improves over previous approaches in view synthesis and camera pose estimation under large motion changes.

| 59 | Gaussian Splatting SLAM | Hidenobu Matsuki,Riku Murai,Paul H. J. Kelly,Andrew J. Davison | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We present the first application of 3D Gaussian Splatting to incremental 3D reconstruction using a single moving monocular or RGB-D camera. Our Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) method, which runs live at 3fps, utilises Gaussians as the only 3D representation, unifying the required representation for accurate, efficient tracking, mapping, and high-quality rendering. Several innovations are required to continuously reconstruct 3D scenes with high fidelity from a live camera. First, to move beyond the original 3DGS algorithm, which requires accurate poses from an offline Structure from Motion (SfM) system, we formulate camera tracking for 3DGS using direct optimisation against the 3D Gaussians, and show that this enables fast and robust tracking with a wide basin of convergence. Second, by utilising the explicit nature of the Gaussians, we introduce geometric verification and regularisation to handle the ambiguities occurring in incremental 3D dense reconstruction. Finally, we introduce a full SLAM system which not only achieves state-of-the-art results in novel view synthesis and trajectory estimation, but also reconstruction of tiny and even transparent objects.</details> | December 2023. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06741](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06741) |

While recent advances in neural implicit rendering have unlocked unprecedented photorealism for digital avatars, real-time performance has mostly been demonstrated for static scenes only. To address this, we propose ASH, an animatable Gaussian splatting approach for photorealistic rendering of dynamic humans in real-time. We parameterize the clothed human as animatable 3D Gaussians, which can be efficiently splatted into image space to generate the final rendering. However, naively learning the Gaussian parameters in 3D space poses a severe challenge in terms of compute. Instead, we attach the Gaussians onto a deformable character model, and learn their parameters in 2D texture space, which allows leveraging efficient 2D convolutional architectures that easily scale with the required number of Gaussians. We benchmark ASH with competing methods on pose-controllable avatars, demonstrating that our method outperforms existing real-time methods by a large margin and shows comparable or even better results than offline methods.</details> | December 2023. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05941](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05941) |

Jeni | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Capturing and re-animating the 3D structure of articulated objects present significant barriers. On one hand, methods requiring extensively calibrated multi-view setups are prohibitively complex and resource-intensive, limiting their practical applicability. On the other hand, while single-camera Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) offer a more streamlined approach, they have excessive training and rendering costs. 3D Gaussian Splatting would be a suitable alternative but for two reasons. Firstly, existing methods for 3D dynamic Gaussians require synchronized multi-view cameras, and secondly, the lack of controllability in dynamic scenarios. We present CoGS, a method for Controllable Gaussian Splatting, that enables the direct manipulation of scene elements, offering real-time control of dynamic scenes without the prerequisite of pre-computing control signals. We evaluated CoGS using both synthetic and real-world datasets that include dynamic objects that differ in degree of difficulty. In our evaluations, CoGS consistently outperformed existing dynamic and controllable neural representations in terms of visual fidelity.</details> | December 2023. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05664](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05664) |

Despite the critical importance of these tasks, existing methodologies often struggle to generate high-caliber results. We begin by examining the inherent limitations in previous diffusion priors. We identify a divergence between the diffusion priors and the training procedures of diffusion models that substantially impairs the quality of 3D generation. To address this issue, we propose a novel, unified framework that iteratively optimizes both the 3D model and the diffusion prior. Leveraging the different learnable parameters of the diffusion prior, our approach offers multiple configurations, affording various trade-offs between performance and implementation complexity. Notably, our experimental results demonstrate that our method markedly surpasses existing techniques, establishing new state-of-the-art in the realm of text-to-3D generation. Furthermore, our approach exhibits impressive performance on both NeRF and the newly introduced 3D Gaussian Splatting backbones. Additionally, our framework yields insightful contributions to the understanding of recent score distillation methods, such as the VSD and DDS loss.</details> | December 2023. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04820](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04820) |
| 55 | LightGaussian: Unbounded 3D Gaussian Compression with 15x Reduction and 200+ FPS | Zhiwen Fan,Kevin Wang,Kairun Wen,Zehao Zhu,Dejia Xu,Zhangyang Wang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Recent advancements in real-time neural rendering using point-based techniques have paved the way for the widespread adoption of 3D representations. However, foundational approaches like 3D Gaussian Splatting come with a substantial storage overhead caused by growing the SfM points to millions, often demanding gigabyte-level disk space for a single unbounded scene, posing significant scalability challenges and hindering the splatting efficiency.  To address this challenge, we introduce LightGaussian, a novel method designed to transform 3D Gaussians into a more efficient and compact format. Drawing inspiration from the concept of Network Pruning, LightGaussian identifies Gaussians that are insignificant in contributing to the scene reconstruction and adopts a pruning and recovery process, effectively reducing redundancy in Gaussian counts while preserving visual effects. Additionally, LightGaussian employs distillation and pseudo-view augmentation to distill spherical harmonics to a lower degree, allowing knowledge transfer to more compact representations while maintaining reflectance. Furthermore, we propose a hybrid scheme, VecTree Quantization, to quantize all attributes, resulting in lower bitwidth representations with minimal accuracy losses.  In summary, LightGaussian achieves an averaged compression rate over 15x while boosting the FPS from 139 to 215, enabling an efficient representation of complex scenes on Mip-NeRF 360, Tank and Temple datasets.

| 54 | EAGLES: Efficient Accelerated 3D Gaussians with Lightweight EncodingS | Sharath Girish,Kamal Gupta,Abhinav Shrivastava | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Recently, 3D Gaussian splatting (3D-GS) has gained popularity in novel-view scene synthesis. It addresses the challenges of lengthy training times and slow rendering speeds associated with Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs). Through rapid, differentiable rasterization of 3D Gaussians, 3D-GS achieves real-time rendering and accelerated training. They, however, demand substantial memory resources for both training and storage, as they require millions of Gaussians in their point cloud representation for each scene. We present a technique utilizing quantized embeddings to significantly reduce memory storage requirements and a coarse-to-fine training strategy for a faster and more stable optimization of the Gaussian point clouds. Our approach results in scene representations with fewer Gaussians and quantized representations, leading to faster training times and rendering speeds for real-time rendering of high resolution scenes. We reduce memory by more than an order of magnitude all while maintaining the reconstruction quality. We validate the effectiveness of our approach on a variety of datasets and scenes preserving the visual quality while consuming 10-20x less memory and faster training/inference speed.

Recent advancements in head avatar techniques, including explicit 3D morphable meshes (3DMM), point clouds, and neural implicit representation have been exploited for this ongoing research. However, 3DMM-based methods are constrained by their fixed topologies, point-based approaches suffer from a heavy training burden due to the extensive quantity of points involved, and the last ones suffer from limitations in deformation flexibility and rendering efficiency. In response to these challenges, we propose MonoGaussianAvatar (Monocular Gaussian Point-based Head Avatar), a novel approach that harnesses 3D Gaussian point representation coupled with a Gaussian deformation field to learn explicit head avatars from monocular portrait videos. We define our head avatars with Gaussian points characterized by adaptable shapes, enabling flexible topology. These points exhibit movement with a Gaussian deformation field in alignment with the target pose and expression of a person, facilitating efficient deformation. Additionally, the Gaussian points have controllable shape, size, color, and opacity combined with Gaussian splatting, allowing for efficient training and rendering. Experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our method, which achieves state-of-the-art results among previous methods.</details> | December 2023. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04558](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04558) |

Yet, efficiently rendering realistic human performance and integrating it into the rasterization pipeline remains challenging. In this paper, we present HiFi4G, an explicit and compact Gaussian-based approach for high-fidelity human performance rendering from dense footage. Our core intuition is to marry the 3D Gaussian representation with non-rigid tracking, achieving a compact and compression-friendly representation. We first propose a dual-graph mechanism to obtain motion priors, with a coarse deformation graph for effective initialization and a fine-grained Gaussian graph to enforce subsequent constraints. Then, we utilize a 4D Gaussian optimization scheme with adaptive spatial-temporal regularizers to effectively balance the non-rigid prior and Gaussian updating. We also present a companion compression scheme with residual compensation for immersive experiences on various platforms. It achieves a substantial compression rate of approximately 25 times, with less than 2MB of storage per frame. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which significantly outperforms existing approaches in terms of optimization speed, rendering quality, and storage overhead.</details> | December 2023. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03461](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03461) |

Especially, to accurately model complex motions, high efficiency is usually hard to guarantee. To achieve real-time dynamic scene rendering while also enjoying high training and storage efficiency, we propose 4D Gaussian Splatting (4D-GS) as a holistic representation for dynamic scenes rather than applying 3D-GS for each individual frame. In 4D-GS, a novel explicit representation containing both 3D Gaussians and 4D neural voxels is proposed. A decomposed neural voxel encoding algorithm inspired by HexPlane is proposed to efficiently build Gaussian features from 4D neural voxels and then a lightweight MLP is applied to predict Gaussian deformations at novel timestamps. Our 4D-GS method achieves real-time rendering under high resolutions, 82 FPS at an 800$\\times$800 resolution on an RTX 3090 GPU while maintaining comparable or better quality than previous state-of-the-art methods.

| 50 | Gaussian-Flow: 4D Reconstruction with Dynamic 3D Gaussian Particle | Youtian Lin,Zuozhuo Dai,Siyu Zhu,Yao Yao | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We introduce Gaussian-Flow, a novel point-based approach for fast dynamic scene reconstruction and real-time rendering from both multi-view and monocular videos. In contrast to the prevalent NeRF-based approaches hampered by slow training and rendering speeds, our approach harnesses recent advancements in point-based 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Specifically, a novel Dual-Domain Deformation Model (DDDM) is proposed to explicitly model attribute deformations of each Gaussian point, where the time-dependent residual of each attribute is captured by a polynomial fitting in the time domain, and a Fourier series fitting in the frequency domain. The proposed DDDM is capable of modeling complex scene deformations across long video footage, eliminating the need for training separate 3DGS for each frame or introducing an additional implicit neural field to model 3D dynamics. Moreover, the explicit deformation modeling for discretized Gaussian points ensures ultra-fast training and rendering of a 4D scene, which is comparable to the original 3DGS designed for static 3D reconstruction. Our proposed approach showcases a substantial efficiency improvement, achieving a $5\\times$ faster training speed compared to the per-frame 3DGS modeling. In addition, quantitative results demonstrate that the proposed Gaussian-Flow significantly outperforms previous leading methods in novel view rendering quality.

Methods that use Neural Radiance fields are versatile for traditional tasks such as novel view synthesis. In recent times, some work has emerged that aims to extend the functionality of NeRF beyond view synthesis, for semantically aware tasks such as editing and segmentation using 3D feature field distillation from 2D foundation models. However, these methods have two major limitations: (a) they are limited by the rendering speed of NeRF pipelines, and (b) implicitly represented feature fields suffer from continuity artifacts reducing feature quality. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting has shown state-of-the-art performance on real-time radiance field rendering. In this work, we go one step further: in addition to radiance field rendering, we enable 3D Gaussian splatting on arbitrary-dimension semantic features via 2D foundation model distillation. This translation is not straightforward: naively incorporating feature fields in the 3DGS framework leads to warp-level divergence. We propose architectural and training changes to efficiently avert this problem. Our proposed method is general, and our experiments showcase novel view semantic segmentation, language-guided editing and segment anything through learning feature fields from state-of-the-art 2D foundation models such as SAM and CLIP-LSeg. Across experiments, our distillation method is able to provide comparable or better results, while being significantly faster to both train and render. Additionally, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first method to enable point and bounding-box prompting for radiance field manipulation, by leveraging the SAM model.

Specifically, GauHuman encodes Gaussian Splatting in the canonical space and transforms 3D Gaussians from canonical space to posed space with linear blend skinning (LBS), in which effective pose and LBS refinement modules are designed to learn fine details of 3D humans under negligible computational cost. Moreover, to enable fast optimization of GauHuman, we initialize and prune 3D Gaussians with 3D human prior, while splitting/cloning via KL divergence guidance, along with a novel merge operation for further speeding up. Extensive experiments on ZJU_Mocap and MonoCap datasets demonstrate that GauHuman achieves state-of-the-art performance quantitatively and qualitatively with fast training and real-time rendering speed. Notably, without sacrificing rendering quality, GauHuman can fast model the 3D human performer with ~13k 3D Gaussians.</details> | December 2023. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02973](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02973) |

Both 2D and 3D diffusion models can help generate decent 3D objects based on prompts. 3D diffusion models have good 3D consistency, but their quality and generalization are limited as trainable 3D data is expensive and hard to obtain. 2D diffusion models enjoy strong abilities of generalization and fine generation, but 3D consistency is hard to guarantee. This paper attempts to bridge the power from the two types of diffusion models via the recent explicit and efficient 3D Gaussian splatting representation. A fast 3D object generation framework, named as GaussianDreamer, is proposed, where the 3D diffusion model provides priors for initialization and the 2D diffusion model enriches the geometry and appearance. Operations of noisy point growing and color perturbation are introduced to enhance the initialized Gaussians.

However, this challenging problem requires accurate modeling of the contact between hands and objects. To capture grasps, existing methods use skeletons, meshes, or parametric models that can cause misalignments resulting in inaccurate contacts. We present MANUS, a method for Markerless Hand-Object Grasp Capture using Articulated 3D Gaussians. We build a novel articulated 3D Gaussians representation that extends 3D Gaussian splatting for high-fidelity representation of articulating hands. Since our representation uses Gaussian primitives, it enables us to efficiently and accurately estimate contacts between the hand and the object. For the most accurate results, our method requires tens of camera views that current datasets do not provide. We therefore build MANUS-Grasps, a new dataset that contains hand-object grasps viewed from 53 cameras across 30+ scenes, 3 subjects, and comprising over 7M frames.

This combination facilitates photorealistic rendering while allowing for precise animation control via the underlying parametric model, e.g., through expression transfer from a driving sequence or by manually changing the morphable model parameters. We parameterize each splat by a local coordinate frame of a triangle and optimize for explicit displacement offset to obtain a more accurate geometric representation. During avatar reconstruction, we jointly optimize for the morphable model parameters and Gaussian splat parameters in an end-to-end fashion.

| 39 | GS-IR: 3D Gaussian Splatting for Inverse Rendering | Zhihao Liang,Qi Zhang,Ying Feng,Ying Shan,Kui Jia | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We propose GS-IR, a novel inverse rendering approach based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) that leverages forward mapping volume rendering to achieve photorealistic novel view synthesis and relighting results. Unlike previous works that use implicit neural representations and volume rendering (e.g. NeRF), which suffer from low expressive power and high computational complexity, we extend GS, a top-performance representation for novel view synthesis, to estimate scene geometry, surface material, and environment illumination from multi-view images captured under unknown lighting conditions. There are two main problems when introducing GS to inverse rendering: 1) GS does not support producing plausible normal natively; 2) forward mapping (e.g. rasterization and splatting) cannot trace the occlusion like backward mapping (e.g. ray tracing). To address these challenges, our GS-IR proposes an efficient optimization scheme that incorporates a depth-derivation-based regularization for normal estimation and a baking-based occlusion to model indirect lighting. The flexible and expressive GS representation allows us to achieve fast and compact geometry reconstruction, photorealistic novel view synthesis, and effective physically-based rendering. We demonstrate the superiority of our method over baseline methods through qualitative and quantitative evaluations on various challenging scenes.</details> | November 2023. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16473](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16473) |
| 38 | SuGaR: Surface-Aligned Gaussian Splatting for Efficient 3D Mesh Reconstruction and High-Quality Mesh Rendering | Antoine Gu\xc3\xa9don,Vincent Lepetit | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We propose a method to allow precise and extremely fast mesh extraction from 3D Gaussian Splatting. Gaussian Splatting has recently become very popular as it yields realistic rendering while being significantly faster to train than NeRFs. It is however challenging to extract a mesh from the millions of tiny 3D gaussians as these gaussians tend to be unorganized after optimization and no method has been proposed so far. Our first key contribution is a regularization term that encourages the gaussians to align well with the surface of the scene. We then introduce a method that exploits this alignment to extract a mesh from the Gaussians using Poisson reconstruction, which is fast, scalable, and preserves details, in contrast to the Marching Cubes algorithm usually applied to extract meshes from Neural SDFs. Finally, we introduce an optional refinement strategy that binds gaussians to the surface of the mesh, and jointly optimizes these Gaussians and the mesh through Gaussian splatting rendering. This enables easy editing, sculpting, rigging, animating, compositing and relighting of the Gaussians using traditional softwares by manipulating the mesh instead of the gaussians themselves. Retrieving such an editable mesh for realistic rendering is done within minutes with our method, compared to hours with the state-of-the-art methods on neural SDFs, while providing a better rendering quality.

While recent advancements in text-to-3D generation have shown promise, they often fall short in rendering detailed and high-quality 3D models. This problem is especially prevalent as many methods base themselves on Score Distillation Sampling (SDS). This paper identifies a notable deficiency in SDS, that it brings inconsistent and low-quality updating direction for the 3D model, causing the over-smoothing effect. To address this, we propose a novel approach called Interval Score Matching (ISM). ISM employs deterministic diffusing trajectories and utilizes interval-based score matching to counteract over-smoothing. Furthermore, we incorporate 3D Gaussian Splatting into our text-to-3D generation pipeline.

| 35 | Gaussian Grouping: Segment and Edit Anything in 3D Scenes | Mingqiao Ye,Martin Danelljan,Fisher Yu,Lei Ke | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>The recent Gaussian Splatting achieves high-quality and real-time novel-view synthesis of the 3D scenes. However, it is solely concentrated on the appearance and geometry modeling, while lacking in fine-grained object-level scene understanding. To address this issue, we propose Gaussian Grouping, which extends Gaussian Splatting to jointly reconstruct and segment anything in open-world 3D scenes. We augment each Gaussian with a compact Identity Encoding, allowing the Gaussians to be grouped according to their object instance or stuff membership in the 3D scene. Instead of resorting to expensive 3D labels, we supervise the Identity Encodings during the differentiable rendering by leveraging the 2D mask predictions by SAM, along with introduced 3D spatial consistency regularization. Comparing to the implicit NeRF representation, we show that the discrete and grouped 3D Gaussians can reconstruct, segment and edit anything in 3D with high visual quality, fine granularity and efficiency. Based on Gaussian Grouping, we further propose a local Gaussian Editing scheme, which shows efficacy in versatile scene editing applications, including 3D object removal, inpainting, colorization and scene recomposition. Our code and models will be at https://github.com/lkeab/gaussian-grouping.</details> | December 2023. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00732](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00732) |
| 34 | FSGS: Real-Time Few-shot View Synthesis using Gaussian Splatting | Zehao Zhu,Zhiwen Fan,Yifan Jiang,Zhangyang Wang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Novel view synthesis from limited observations remains an important and persistent task. However, high efficiency in existing NeRF-based few-shot view synthesis is often compromised to obtain an accurate 3D representation. To address this challenge, we propose a few-shot view synthesis framework based on 3D Gaussian Splatting that enables real-time and photo-realistic view synthesis with as few as three training views. The proposed method, dubbed FSGS, handles the extremely sparse initialized SfM points with a thoughtfully designed Gaussian Unpooling process. Our method iteratively distributes new Gaussians around the most representative locations, subsequently infilling local details in vacant areas. We also integrate a large-scale pre-trained monocular depth estimator within the Gaussians optimization process, leveraging online augmented views to guide the geometric optimization towards an optimal solution. Starting from sparse points observed from limited input viewpoints, our FSGS can accurately grow into unseen regions, comprehensively covering the scene and boosting the rendering quality of novel views. Overall, FSGS achieves state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and rendering efficiency across diverse datasets, including LLFF, Mip-NeRF360, and Blender.

| 33 | NeuSG: Neural Implicit Surface Reconstruction with 3D Gaussian Splatting Guidance | Hanlin Chen,Chen Li,Gim Hee Lee | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Existing neural implicit surface reconstruction methods have achieved impressive performance in multi-view 3D reconstruction by leveraging explicit geometry priors such as depth maps or point clouds as regularization. However, the reconstruction results still lack fine details because of the over-smoothed depth map or sparse point cloud. In this work, we propose a neural implicit surface reconstruction pipeline with guidance from 3D Gaussian Splatting to recover highly detailed surfaces. The advantage of 3D Gaussian Splatting is that it can generate dense point clouds with detailed structure. Nonetheless, a naive adoption of 3D Gaussian Splatting can fail since the generated points are the centers of 3D Gaussians that do not necessarily lie on the surface. We thus introduce a scale regularizer to pull the centers close to the surface by enforcing the 3D Gaussians to be extremely thin. Moreover, we propose to refine the point cloud from 3D Gaussians Splatting with the normal priors from the surface predicted by neural implicit models instead of using a fixed set of points as guidance. Consequently, the quality of surface reconstruction improves from the guidance of the more accurate 3D Gaussian splatting. By jointly optimizing the 3D Gaussian Splatting and the neural implicit model, our approach benefits from both representations and generates complete surfaces with intricate details. Experiments on Tanks and Temples verify the effectiveness of our proposed method.</details> | December 2023. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00846](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00846) |
| 32 | SparseGS: Real-Time 360\xc2\xb0 Sparse View Synthesis using Gaussian Splatting | Haolin Xiong,Sairisheek Muttukuru,Rishi Upadhyay,Pradyumna Chari,Achuta Kadambi | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>The problem of novel view synthesis has grown significantly in popularity recently with the introduction of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) and other implicit scene representation methods. A recent advance, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), leverages an explicit representation to achieve real-time rendering with high-quality results. However, 3DGS still requires an abundance of training views to generate a coherent scene representation. In few shot settings, similar to NeRF, 3DGS tends to overfit to training views, causing background collapse and excessive floaters, especially as the number of training views are reduced. We propose a method to enable training coherent 3DGS-based radiance fields of 360 scenes from sparse training views. We find that using naive depth priors is not sufficient and integrate depth priors with generative and explicit constraints to reduce background collapse, remove floaters, and enhance consistency from unseen viewpoints. Experiments show that our method outperforms base 3DGS by up to 30.5% and NeRF-based methods by up to 15.6% in LPIPS on the MipNeRF-360 dataset with substantially less training and inference cost.</details> | December 2023. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00206](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00206) |
| 31 | DynMF: Neural Motion Factorization for Real-time Dynamic View Synthesis with 3D Gaussian Splatting | Agelos Kratimenos,Jiahui Lei,Kostas Daniilidis | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Accurately and efficiently modeling dynamic scenes and motions is considered so challenging a task due to temporal dynamics and motion complexity. To address these challenges, we propose DynMF, a compact and efficient representation that decomposes a dynamic scene into a few neural trajectories. We argue that the per-point motions of a dynamic scene can be decomposed into a small set of explicit or learned trajectories. Our carefully designed neural framework consisting of a tiny set of learned basis queried only in time allows for rendering speed similar to 3D Gaussian Splatting, surpassing 120 FPS, while at the same time, requiring only double the storage compared to static scenes. Our neural representation adequately constrains the inherently underconstrained motion field of a dynamic scene leading to effective and fast optimization. This is done by biding each point to motion coefficients that enforce the per-point sharing of basis trajectories. By carefully applying a sparsity loss to the motion coefficients, we are able to disentangle the motions that comprise the scene, independently control them, and generate novel motion combinations that have never been seen before. We can reach state-of-the-art render quality within just 5 minutes of training and in less than half an hour, we can synthesize novel views of dynamic scenes with superior photorealistic quality. Our representation is interpretable, efficient, and expressive enough to offer real-time view synthesis of complex dynamic scene motions, in monocular and multi-view scenarios.</details> | December 2023. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00112](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00112) |

Duisterhof,Zhao Mandi,Yunchao Yao,Jia-Wei Liu,Mike Zheng Shou,Shuran Song,Jeffrey Ichnowski | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Accurate 3D tracking in highly deformable scenes with occlusions and shadows can facilitate new applications in robotics, augmented reality, and generative AI. However, tracking under these conditions is extremely challenging due to the ambiguity that arises with large deformations, shadows, and occlusions. We introduce MD-Splatting, an approach for simultaneous 3D tracking and novel view synthesis, using video captures of a dynamic scene from various camera poses. MD-Splatting builds on recent advances in Gaussian splatting, a method that learns the properties of a large number of Gaussians for state-of-the-art and fast novel view synthesis. MD-Splatting learns a deformation function to project a set of Gaussians with non-metric, thus canonical, properties into metric space. The deformation function uses a neural-voxel encoding and a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to infer Gaussian position, rotation, and a shadow scalar. We enforce physics-inspired regularization terms based on local rigidity, conservation of momentum, and isometry, which leads to trajectories with smaller trajectory errors. MD-Splatting achieves high-quality 3D tracking on highly deformable scenes with shadows and occlusions. Compared to state-of-the-art, we improve 3D tracking by an average of 23.9 %, while simultaneously achieving high-quality novel view synthesis. With sufficient texture such as in scene 6, MD-Splatting achieves a median tracking error of 3.39 mm on a cloth of 1 x 1 meters in size.

The recent 3D Gaussian Splatting method has achieved the state-of-the-art rendering quality and speed combining the benefits of both primitive-based representations and volumetric representations. However, it often leads to heavily redundant Gaussians that try to fit every training view, neglecting the underlying scene geometry. Consequently, the resulting model becomes less robust to significant view changes, texture-less area and lighting effects. We introduce Scaffold-GS, which uses anchor points to distribute local 3D Gaussians, and predicts their attributes on-the-fly based on viewing direction and distance within the view frustum. Anchor growing and pruning strategies are developed based on the importance of neural Gaussians to reliably improve the scene coverage. We show that our method effectively reduces redundant Gaussians while delivering high-quality rendering. We also demonstrates an enhanced capability to accommodate scenes with varying levels-of-detail and view-dependent observations, without sacrificing the rendering speed.</details> | December 2023. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00109](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00109) |
| 28 | Periodic Vibration Gaussian: Dynamic Urban Scene Reconstruction and Real-time Rendering | Yurui Chen,Chun Gu,Junzhe Jiang,Xiatian Zhu,Li Zhang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Modeling dynamic, large-scale urban scenes is challenging due to their highly intricate geometric structures and unconstrained dynamics in both space and time. Prior methods often employ high-level architectural priors, separating static and dynamic elements, resulting in suboptimal capture of their synergistic interactions. To address this challenge, we present a unified representation model, called Periodic Vibration Gaussian (PVG). PVG builds upon the efficient 3D Gaussian splatting technique, originally designed for static scene representation, by introducing periodic vibration-based temporal dynamics. This innovation enables PVG to elegantly and uniformly represent the characteristics of various objects and elements in dynamic urban scenes. To enhance temporally coherent representation learning with sparse training data, we introduce a novel flow-based temporal smoothing mechanism and a position-aware adaptive control strategy. Extensive experiments on Waymo Open Dataset and KITTI benchmarks demonstrate that PVG surpasses state-of-the-art alternatives in both reconstruction and novel view synthesis for both dynamic and static scenes. Notably, PVG achieves this without relying on manually labeled object bounding boxes or expensive optical flow estimation. Moreover, PVG exhibits 50/6000-fold acceleration in training/rendering over the best alternative.</details> | November 2023. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18561](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18561) |

Our method addresses the prevalent challenges in 4D editing, notably the inefficiencies of existing 4D representations and the inconsistent editing effect caused by diffusion-based editors. We first propose GaussianPlanes, a novel 4D representation that makes Gaussian Splatting more structured by applying plane-based decomposition in 3D space and time. This enhances both efficiency and robustness in 4D editing. Furthermore, we propose to leverage a 4D generator to learn a more continuous generation space from inconsistent edited images produced by the diffusion-based editor, which effectively improves the consistency and quality of 4D editing. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates the superiority of Control4D, including significantly reduced training time, high-quality rendering, and spatial-temporal consistency in 4D portrait editing.

However, it comes with a drawback in the much larger storage demand compared to NeRF methods since it needs to store the parameters for several 3D Gaussians. We notice that many Gaussians may share similar parameters, so we introduce a simple vector quantization method based on \\kmeans algorithm to quantize the Gaussian parameters. Then, we store the small codebook along with the index of the code for each Gaussian. Moreover, we compress the indices further by sorting them and using a method similar to run-length encoding. We do extensive experiments on standard benchmarks as well as a new benchmark which is an order of magnitude larger than the standard benchmarks. We show that our simple yet effective method can reduce the storage cost for the original 3D Gaussian Splatting method by a factor of almost $20\\times$ with a very small drop in the quality of rendered images.</details> | November 2023. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18159](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18159) |
| 25 | HUGS: Human Gaussian Splats | Muhammed Kocabas,Jen-Hao Rick Chang,James Gabriel,Oncel Tuzel,Anurag Ranjan | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Recent advances in neural rendering have improved both training and rendering times by orders of magnitude. While these methods demonstrate state-of-the-art quality and speed, they are designed for photogrammetry of static scenes and do not generalize well to freely moving humans in the environment. In this work, we introduce Human Gaussian Splats (HUGS) that represents an animatable human together with the scene using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Our method takes only a monocular video with a small number of (50-100) frames, and it automatically learns to disentangle the static scene and a fully animatable human avatar within 30 minutes. We utilize the SMPL body model to initialize the human Gaussians. To capture details that are not modeled by SMPL (e.g. cloth, hairs), we allow the 3D Gaussians to deviate from the human body model. Utilizing 3D Gaussians for animated humans brings new challenges, including the artifacts created when articulating the Gaussians. We propose to jointly optimize the linear blend skinning weights to coordinate the movements of individual Gaussians during animation. Our approach enables novel-pose synthesis of human and novel view synthesis of both the human and the scene. We achieve state-of-the-art rendering quality with a rendering speed of 60 FPS while being ~100x faster to train over previous work.

Recently, these models have been shown to provide useful guidance for the generation of 3D graphics assets. However, existing work in text-conditioned 3D generation faces fundamental constraints: (i) inability to generate detailed, multi-object scenes, (ii) inability to textually control multi-object configurations, and (iii) physically realistic scene composition. In this work, we propose CG3D, a method for compositionally generating scalable 3D assets that resolves these constraints. We find that explicit Gaussian radiance fields, parameterized to allow for compositions of objects, possess the capability to enable semantically and physically consistent scenes. By utilizing a guidance framework built around this explicit representation, we show state of the art results, capable of even exceeding the guiding diffusion model in terms of object combinations and physics accuracy.</details> | November 2023. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17907](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17907) |

Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have greatly advanced image rendering and reconstruction, but the limited availability of 2D images poses uncertainties stemming from occlusions, depth ambiguities, and imaging errors. Efficiently selecting informative views becomes crucial, and quantifying NeRF model uncertainty presents intricate challenges. Existing approaches either depend on model architecture or are based on assumptions regarding density distributions that are not generally applicable. By leveraging Fisher Information, we efficiently quantify observed information within Radiance Fields without ground truth data. This can be used for the next best view selection and pixel-wise uncertainty quantification. Our method overcomes existing limitations on model architecture and effectiveness, achieving state-of-the-art results in both view selection and uncertainty quantification, demonstrating its potential to advance the field of Radiance Fields.

However, the explicit and discrete representation encounters challenges when applied to scenes featuring reflective surfaces. In this paper, we present GaussianShader, a novel method that applies a simplified shading function on 3D Gaussians to enhance the neural rendering in scenes with reflective surfaces while preserving the training and rendering efficiency. The main challenge in applying the shading function lies in the accurate normal estimation on discrete 3D Gaussians. Specifically, we proposed a novel normal estimation framework based on the shortest axis directions of 3D Gaussians with a delicately designed loss to make the consistency between the normals and the geometries of Gaussian spheres. Experiments show that GaussianShader strikes a commendable balance between efficiency and visual quality. Our method surpasses Gaussian Splatting in PSNR on specular object datasets, exhibiting an improvement of 1.57dB.

Existing methods optimize 3D representations like mesh or neural fields via score distillation sampling (SDS), which suffers from inadequate fine details or excessive training time. In this paper, we propose an efficient yet effective framework, HumanGaussian, that generates high-quality 3D humans with fine-grained geometry and realistic appearance. Our key insight is that 3D Gaussian Splatting is an efficient renderer with periodic Gaussian shrinkage or growing, where such adaptive density control can be naturally guided by intrinsic human structures. Specifically, 1) we first propose a Structure-Aware SDS that simultaneously optimizes human appearance and geometry. The multi-modal score function from both RGB and depth space is leveraged to distill the Gaussian densification and pruning process. 2) Moreover, we devise an Annealed Negative Prompt Guidance by decomposing SDS into a noisier generative score and a cleaner classifier score, which well addresses the over-saturation issue. The floating artifacts are further eliminated based on Gaussian size in a prune-only phase to enhance generation smoothness.

While the classical approaches to model and render virtual humans generally use a textured mesh, recent research has developed neural body representations that achieve impressive visual quality. However, these models are difficult to render in real-time and their quality degrades when the character is animated with body poses different than the training observations. We propose the first animatable human model based on 3D Gaussian Splatting, that has recently emerged as a very efficient alternative to neural radiance fields. Our body is represented by a set of gaussian primitives in a canonical space which are deformed in a coarse to fine approach that combines forward skinning and local non-rigid refinement. We describe how to learn our Human Gaussian Splatting (\\OURS) model in an end-to-end fashion from multi-view observations, and evaluate it against the state-of-the-art approaches for novel pose synthesis of clothed body.

| 18 | Multi-Scale 3D Gaussian Splatting for Anti-Aliased Rendering | Zhiwen Yan,Weng Fei Low,Yu Chen,Gim Hee Lee | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussians have recently emerged as a highly efficient representation for 3D reconstruction and rendering. Despite its high rendering quality and speed at high resolutions, they both deteriorate drastically when rendered at lower resolutions or from far away camera position. During low resolution or far away rendering, the pixel size of the image can fall below the Nyquist frequency compared to the screen size of each splatted 3D Gaussian and leads to aliasing effect. The rendering is also drastically slowed down by the sequential alpha blending of more splatted Gaussians per pixel. To address these issues, we propose a multi-scale 3D Gaussian splatting algorithm, which maintains Gaussians at different scales to represent the same scene. Higher-resolution images are rendered with more small Gaussians, and lower-resolution images are rendered with fewer larger Gaussians. With similar training time, our algorithm can achieve 13\\%-66\\% PSNR and 160\\%-2400\\% rendering speed improvement at 4$\\times$-128$\\times$ scale rendering on Mip-NeRF360 dataset compared to the single scale 3D Gaussian splatting.</details> | November 2023. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17089](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17089) |

Recent works usually adopt MLP-based neural radiance fields (NeRF) to represent 3D humans, but it remains difficult for pure MLPs to regress pose-dependent garment details. To this end, we introduce Animatable Gaussians, a new avatar representation that leverages powerful 2D CNNs and 3D Gaussian splatting to create high-fidelity avatars. To associate 3D Gaussians with the animatable avatar, we learn a parametric template from the input videos, and then parameterize the template on two front \\& back canonical Gaussian maps where each pixel represents a 3D Gaussian. The learned template is adaptive to the wearing garments for modeling looser clothes like dresses. Such template-guided 2D parameterization enables us to employ a powerful StyleGAN-based CNN to learn the pose-dependent Gaussian maps for modeling detailed dynamic appearances. Furthermore, we introduce a pose projection strategy for better generalization given novel poses. Overall, our method can create lifelike avatars with dynamic, realistic and generalized appearances. Experiments show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches.

Specifically, a 3D scene is represented as a set of relightable 3D Gaussian points, where each point is additionally associated with a normal direction, BRDF parameters, and incident lights from different directions. To achieve robust lighting estimation, we further divide incident lights of each point into global and local components, as well as view-dependent visibilities. The 3D scene is optimized through the 3D Gaussian Splatting technique while BRDF and lighting are decomposed by physically-based differentiable rendering. Moreover, we introduce an innovative point-based ray-tracing approach based on the bounding volume hierarchy for efficient visibility baking, enabling real-time rendering and relighting of 3D Gaussian points with accurate shadow effects. Extensive experiments demonstrate improved BRDF estimation and novel view rendering results compared to state-of-the-art material estimation approaches.

| 15 | GaussianEditor: Editing 3D Gaussians Delicately with Text Instructions | Jiemin Fang,Junjie Wang,Xiaopeng Zhang,Lingxi Xie,Qi Tian | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Recently, impressive results have been achieved in 3D scene editing with text instructions based on a 2D diffusion model. However, current diffusion models primarily generate images by predicting noise in the latent space, and the editing is usually applied to the whole image, which makes it challenging to perform delicate, especially localized, editing for 3D scenes. Inspired by recent 3D Gaussian splatting, we propose a systematic framework, named GaussianEditor, to edit 3D scenes delicately via 3D Gaussians with text instructions. Benefiting from the explicit property of 3D Gaussians, we design a series of techniques to achieve delicate editing. Specifically, we first extract the region of interest (RoI) corresponding to the text instruction, aligning it to 3D Gaussians. The Gaussian RoI is further used to control the editing process. Our framework can achieve more delicate and precise editing of 3D scenes than previous methods while enjoying much faster training speed, i.e. within 20 minutes on a single V100 GPU, more than twice as fast as Instruct-NeRF2NeRF (45 minutes -- 2 hours).</details> | November 2023. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16037](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16037) |

However, strong artifacts can be observed when changing the sampling rate, \\eg, by changing focal length or camera distance. We find that the source for this phenomenon can be attributed to the lack of 3D frequency constraints and the usage of a 2D dilation filter. To address this problem, we introduce a 3D smoothing filter which constrains the size of the 3D Gaussian primitives based on the maximal sampling frequency induced by the input views, eliminating high-frequency artifacts when zooming in. Moreover, replacing 2D dilation with a 2D Mip filter, which simulates a 2D box filter, effectively mitigates aliasing and dilation issues. Our evaluation, including scenarios such a training on single-scale images and testing on multiple scales, validates the effectiveness of our approach.</details> | November 2023. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16493](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16493) |
| 13 | LucidDreamer: Domain-free Generation of 3D Gaussian Splatting Scenes | Jaeyoung Chung,Suyoung Lee,Hyeongjin Nam,Jaerin Lee,Kyoung Mu Lee | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>With the widespread usage of VR devices and contents, demands for 3D scene generation techniques become more popular. Existing 3D scene generation models, however, limit the target scene to specific domain, primarily due to their training strategies using 3D scan dataset that is far from the real-world. To address such limitation, we propose LucidDreamer, a domain-free scene generation pipeline by fully leveraging the power of existing large-scale diffusion-based generative model. Our LucidDreamer has two alternate steps: Dreaming and Alignment. First, to generate multi-view consistent images from inputs, we set the point cloud as a geometrical guideline for each image generation. Specifically, we project a portion of point cloud to the desired view and provide the projection as a guidance for inpainting using the generative model. The inpainted images are lifted to 3D space with estimated depth maps, composing a new points. Second, to aggregate the new points into the 3D scene, we propose an aligning algorithm which harmoniously integrates the portions of newly generated 3D scenes. The finally obtained 3D scene serves as initial points for optimizing Gaussian splats. LucidDreamer produces Gaussian splats that are highly-detailed compared to the previous 3D scene generation methods, with no constraint on domain of the target scene.

| 12 | Compact 3D Gaussian Representation for Radiance Field | Joo Chan Lee,Daniel Rho,Xiangyu Sun,Jong Hwan Ko,Eunbyung Park | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in capturing complex 3D scenes with high fidelity. However, one persistent challenge that hinders the widespread adoption of NeRFs is the computational bottleneck due to the volumetric rendering. On the other hand, 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as an alternative representation that leverages a 3D Gaussisan-based representation and adopts the rasterization pipeline to render the images rather than volumetric rendering, achieving very fast rendering speed and promising image quality. However, a significant drawback arises as 3DGS entails a substantial number of 3D Gaussians to maintain the high fidelity of the rendered images, which requires a large amount of memory and storage. To address this critical issue, we place a specific emphasis on two key objectives: reducing the number of Gaussian points without sacrificing performance and compressing the Gaussian attributes, such as view-dependent color and covariance. To this end, we propose a learnable mask strategy that significantly reduces the number of Gaussians while preserving high performance. In addition, we propose a compact but effective representation of view-dependent color by employing a grid-based neural field rather than relying on spherical harmonics. Finally, we learn codebooks to compactly represent the geometric attributes of Gaussian by vector quantization. In our extensive experiments, we consistently show over 10$\\times$ reduced storage and enhanced rendering speed, while maintaining the quality of the scene representation, compared to 3DGS. Our work provides a comprehensive framework for 3D scene representation, achieving high performance, fast training, compactness, and real-time rendering.

| 11 | An Efficient 3D Gaussian Representation for Monocular/Multi-view Dynamic Scenes | Kai Katsumata,Duc Minh Vo,Hideki Nakayama | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>In novel view synthesis of scenes from multiple input views, 3D Gaussian splatting emerges as a viable alternative to existing radiance field approaches, delivering great visual quality and real-time rendering. While successful in static scenes, the present advancement of 3D Gaussian representation, however, faces challenges in dynamic scenes in terms of memory consumption and the need for numerous observations per time step, due to the onus of storing 3D Gaussian parameters per time step. In this study, we present an efficient 3D Gaussian representation tailored for dynamic scenes in which we define positions and rotations as functions of time while leaving other time-invariant properties of the static 3D Gaussian unchanged. Notably, our representation reduces memory usage, which is consistent regardless of the input sequence length. Additionally, it mitigates the risk of overfitting observed frames by accounting for temporal changes. The optimization of our Gaussian representation based on image and flow reconstruction results in a powerful framework for dynamic scene view synthesis in both monocular and multi-view cases. We obtain the highest rendering speed of $118$ frames per second (FPS) at a resolution of $1352 \\times 1014$ with a single GPU, showing the practical usability and effectiveness of our proposed method in dynamic scene rendering scenarios.</details> | November 2023. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12897](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12897) |
| 10 | GS-SLAM: Dense Visual SLAM with 3D Gaussian Splatting | Chi Yan,Delin Qu,Dong Wang,Dan Xu,Zhigang Wang,Bin Zhao,Xuelong Li | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>In this paper, we introduce $\\textbf{GS-SLAM}$ that first utilizes 3D Gaussian representation in the Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) system. It facilitates a better balance between efficiency and accuracy. Compared to recent SLAM methods employing neural implicit representations, our method utilizes a real-time differentiable splatting rendering pipeline that offers significant speedup to map optimization and RGB-D re-rendering. Specifically, we propose an adaptive expansion strategy that adds new or deletes noisy 3D Gaussian in order to efficiently reconstruct new observed scene geometry and improve the mapping of previously observed areas. This strategy is essential to extend 3D Gaussian representation to reconstruct the whole scene rather than synthesize a static object in existing methods. Moreover, in the pose tracking process, an effective coarse-to-fine technique is designed to select reliable 3D Gaussian representations to optimize camera pose, resulting in runtime reduction and robust estimation. Our method achieves competitive performance compared with existing state-of-the-art real-time methods on the Replica, TUM-RGBD datasets. The source code will be released soon.</details> | November 2023. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11700](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11700) |
| 9 | Deformable 3D Gaussians for High-Fidelity Monocular Dynamic Scene Reconstruction | Ziyi Yang,Xinyu Gao,Wen Zhou,Shaohui Jiao,Yuqing Zhang,Xiaogang Jin | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Implicit neural representation has paved the way for new approaches to dynamic scene reconstruction and rendering. Nonetheless, cutting-edge dynamic neural rendering methods rely heavily on these implicit representations, which frequently struggle to capture the intricate details of objects in the scene. Furthermore, implicit methods have difficulty achieving real-time rendering in general dynamic scenes, limiting their use in a variety of tasks. To address the issues, we propose a deformable 3D Gaussians Splatting method that reconstructs scenes using 3D Gaussians and learns them in canonical space with a deformation field to model monocular dynamic scenes. We also introduce an annealing smoothing training mechanism with no extra overhead, which can mitigate the impact of inaccurate poses on the smoothness of time interpolation tasks in real-world datasets. Through a differential Gaussian rasterizer, the deformable 3D Gaussians not only achieve higher rendering quality but also real-time rendering speed. Experiments show that our method outperforms existing methods significantly in terms of both rendering quality and speed, making it well-suited for tasks such as novel-view synthesis, time interpolation, and real-time rendering.</details> | September 2023. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13101](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13101) |
| 8 | GaussianDiffusion: 3D Gaussian Splatting for Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models with Structured Noise | Xinhai Li,Huaibin Wang,Kuo-Kun Tseng | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Text-to-3D, known for its efficient generation methods and expansive creative potential, has garnered significant attention in the AIGC domain. However, the amalgamation of Nerf and 2D diffusion models frequently yields oversaturated images, posing severe limitations on downstream industrial applications due to the constraints of pixelwise rendering method. Gaussian splatting has recently superseded the traditional pointwise sampling technique prevalent in NeRF-based methodologies, revolutionizing various aspects of 3D reconstruction. This paper introduces a novel text to 3D content generation framework based on Gaussian splatting, enabling fine control over image saturation through individual Gaussian sphere transparencies, thereby producing more realistic images. The challenge of achieving multi-view consistency in 3D generation significantly impedes modeling complexity and accuracy. Taking inspiration from SJC, we explore employing multi-view noise distributions to perturb images generated by 3D Gaussian splatting, aiming to rectify inconsistencies in multi-view geometry. We ingeniously devise an efficient method to generate noise that produces Gaussian noise from diverse viewpoints, all originating from a shared noise source. Furthermore, vanilla 3D Gaussian-based generation tends to trap models in local minima, causing artifacts like floaters, burrs, or proliferative elements. To mitigate these issues, we propose the variational Gaussian splatting technique to enhance the quality and stability of 3D appearance. To our knowledge, our approach represents the first comprehensive utilization of Gaussian splatting across the entire spectrum of 3D content generation processes.</details> | November 2023. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11221](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11221) |
| 7 | SplatArmor: Articulated Gaussian splatting for animatable humans from monocular RGB videos | Rohit Jena,Ganesh Subramanian Iyer,Siddharth Choudhary,Brandon Smith,Pratik Chaudhari,James Gee | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We propose SplatArmor, a novel approach for recovering detailed and animatable human models by `armoring' a parameterized body model with 3D Gaussians. Our approach represents the human as a set of 3D Gaussians within a canonical space, whose articulation is defined by extending the skinning of the underlying SMPL geometry to arbitrary locations in the canonical space. To account for pose-dependent effects, we introduce a SE(3) field, which allows us to capture both the location and anisotropy of the Gaussians. Furthermore, we propose the use of a neural color field to provide color regularization and 3D supervision for the precise positioning of these Gaussians. We show that Gaussian splatting provides an interesting alternative to neural rendering based methods by leverging a rasterization primitive without facing any of the non-differentiability and optimization challenges typically faced in such approaches. The rasterization paradigms allows us to leverage forward skinning, and does not suffer from the ambiguities associated with inverse skinning and warping. We show compelling results on the ZJU MoCap and People Snapshot datasets, which underscore the effectiveness of our method for controllable human synthesis.</details> | November 2023. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10812](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10812) |
| 6 | Drivable 3D Gaussian Avatars | Wojciech Zielonka,Timur Bagautdinov,Shunsuke Saito,Michael Zollh\xc3\xb6fer,Justus Thies,Javier Romero | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We present Drivable 3D Gaussian Avatars (D3GA), the first 3D controllable model for human bodies rendered with Gaussian splats. Current photorealistic drivable avatars require either accurate 3D registrations during training, dense input images during testing, or both. The ones based on neural radiance fields also tend to be prohibitively slow for telepresence applications. This work uses the recently presented 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) technique to render realistic humans at real-time framerates, using dense calibrated multi-view videos as input. To deform those primitives, we depart from the commonly used point deformation method of linear blend skinning (LBS) and use a classic volumetric deformation method: cage deformations. Given their smaller size, we drive these deformations with joint angles and keypoints, which are more suitable for communication applications. Our experiments on nine subjects with varied body shapes, clothes, and motions obtain higher-quality results than state-of-the-art methods when using the same training and test data.</details> | November 2023. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08581](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08581) |
| 5 | Text-to-3D using Gaussian Splatting | Zilong Chen,Feng Wang,Huaping Liu | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>In this paper, we present Gaussian Splatting based text-to-3D generation (GSGEN), a novel approach for generating high-quality 3D objects. Previous methods suffer from inaccurate geometry and limited fidelity due to the absence of 3D prior and proper representation. We leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting, a recent state-of-the-art representation, to address existing shortcomings by exploiting the explicit nature that enables the incorporation of 3D prior. Specifically, our method adopts a progressive optimization strategy, which includes a geometry optimization stage and an appearance refinement stage. In geometry optimization, a coarse representation is established under a 3D geometry prior along with the ordinary 2D SDS loss, ensuring a sensible and 3D-consistent rough shape. Subsequently, the obtained Gaussians undergo an iterative refinement to enrich details. In this stage, we increase the number of Gaussians by compactness-based densification to enhance continuity and improve fidelity. With these designs, our approach can generate 3D content with delicate details and more accurate geometry. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, especially for capturing high-frequency components. Video results are provided at https://gsgen3d.github.io.

| 4 | Dynamic Gaussian Splatting from Markerless Motion Capture can Reconstruct Infants Movements | R. James Cotton,Colleen Peyton | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Easy access to precise 3D tracking of movement could benefit many aspects of rehabilitation. A challenge to achieving this goal is that while there are many datasets and pretrained algorithms for able-bodied adults, algorithms trained on these datasets often fail to generalize to clinical populations including people with disabilities, infants, and neonates. Reliable movement analysis of infants and neonates is important as spontaneous movement behavior is an important indicator of neurological function and neurodevelopmental disability, which can help guide early interventions. We explored the application of dynamic Gaussian splatting to sparse markerless motion capture (MMC) data. Our approach leverages semantic segmentation masks to focus on the infant, significantly improving the initialization of the scene. Our results demonstrate the potential of this method in rendering novel views of scenes and tracking infant movements. This work paves the way for advanced movement analysis tools that can be applied to diverse clinical populations, with a particular emphasis on early detection in infants.</details> | October 2023. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19441](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19441) |
| 3 | Real-time Photorealistic Dynamic Scene Representation and Rendering with 4D Gaussian Splatting | Zeyu Yang,Hongye Yang,Zijie Pan,Xiatian Zhu,Li Zhang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from 2D images and generating diverse views over time is challenging due to scene complexity and temporal dynamics. Despite advancements in neural implicit models, limitations persist: (i) Inadequate Scene Structure: Existing methods struggle to reveal the spatial and temporal structure of dynamic scenes from directly learning the complex 6D plenoptic function. (ii) Scaling Deformation Modeling: Explicitly modeling scene element deformation becomes impractical for complex dynamics. To address these issues, we consider the spacetime as an entirety and propose to approximate the underlying spatio-temporal 4D volume of a dynamic scene by optimizing a collection of 4D primitives, with explicit geometry and appearance modeling. Learning to optimize the 4D primitives enables us to synthesize novel views at any desired time with our tailored rendering routine. Our model is conceptually simple, consisting of a 4D Gaussian parameterized by anisotropic ellipses that can rotate arbitrarily in space and time, as well as view-dependent and time-evolved appearance represented by the coefficient of 4D spherindrical harmonics. This approach offers simplicity, flexibility for variable-length video and end-to-end training, and efficient real-time rendering, making it suitable for capturing complex dynamic scene motions. Experiments across various benchmarks, including monocular and multi-view scenarios, demonstrate our 4DGS model's superior visual quality and efficiency.</details> | October 2023. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10642](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10642) |
| 2 | DreamGaussian: Generative Gaussian Splatting for Efficient 3D Content Creation | Jiaxiang Tang,Jiawei Ren,Hang Zhou,Ziwei Liu,Gang Zeng | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Recent advances in 3D content creation mostly leverage optimization-based 3D generation via score distillation sampling (SDS). Though promising results have been exhibited, these methods often suffer from slow per-sample optimization, limiting their practical usage. In this paper, we propose DreamGaussian, a novel 3D content generation framework that achieves both efficiency and quality simultaneously. Our key insight is to design a generative 3D Gaussian Splatting model with companioned mesh extraction and texture refinement in UV space. In contrast to the occupancy pruning used in Neural Radiance Fields, we demonstrate that the progressive densification of 3D Gaussians converges significantly faster for 3D generative tasks. To further enhance the texture quality and facilitate downstream applications, we introduce an efficient algorithm to convert 3D Gaussians into textured meshes and apply a fine-tuning stage to refine the details. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior efficiency and competitive generation quality of our proposed approach. Notably, DreamGaussian produces high-quality textured meshes in just 2 minutes from a single-view image, achieving approximately 10 times acceleration compared to existing methods.</details> | September 2023. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16653](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16653) |
| 1 | 3D Gaussian Splatting for Real-Time Radiance Field Rendering | Bernhard Kerbl,Georgios Kopanas,Thomas Leimk\xc3\xbchler,George Drettakis | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Radiance Field methods have recently revolutionized novel-view synthesis of scenes captured with multiple photos or videos. However, achieving high visual quality still requires neural networks that are costly to train and render, while recent faster methods inevitably trade off speed for quality. For unbounded and complete scenes (rather than isolated objects) and 1080p resolution rendering, no current method can achieve real-time display rates. We introduce three key elements that allow us to achieve state-of-the-art visual quality while maintaining competitive training times and importantly allow high-quality real-time (>= 30 fps) novel-view synthesis at 1080p resolution. First, starting from sparse points produced during camera calibration, we represent the scene with 3D Gaussians that preserve desirable properties of continuous volumetric radiance fields for scene optimization while avoiding unnecessary computation in empty space; Second, we perform interleaved optimization/density control of the 3D Gaussians, notably optimizing anisotropic covariance to achieve an accurate representation of the scene; Third, we develop a fast visibility-aware rendering algorithm that supports anisotropic splatting and both accelerates training and allows realtime rendering. We demonstrate state-of-the-art visual quality and real-time rendering on several established datasets.</details> | August 2023. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04079](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04079) |
